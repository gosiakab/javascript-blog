                  In any creative endeavor, you have to give yourself permission
                  to create junk. There is no way around it. Sometimes you have
                  to write 4 terrible pages just to discover that you wrote one
                  good sentence in the second paragraph of the third page.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Creating something useful and compelling is like being a gold
                  miner. You have to sift through pounds of dirt and rock and
                  silt just to find a speck of gold in the middle of it all.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Bits and pieces of genius will find their way to you, if you
                  give yourself permission to let the muse flow.

                  No single act will uncover more creative genius than forcing
                  yourself to create consistently. Practicing your craft over
                  and over is the only way to become decent at it. The person
                  who sits around theorizing about what a best-selling book
                  looks like will never write it.

                  Meanwhile, the writer who shows up every day and puts their
                  butt in the chair and their hands on the keyboard — they are
                  learning how to do the work. If you want to do your best
                  creative work, then don't leave it up to choice.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Don't wake up in the morning and think, “I hope I feel
                  inspired to create something today.” You need to take the
                  decision-making out of it. Set a schedule for your work.
                  Genius arrives when you show up enough times to get the
                  average ideas out of the way.

                  Finish something. Anything. Stop researching, planning, and
                  preparing to do the work and just do the work. It doesn't
                  matter how good or how bad it is. You don't need to set the
                  world on fire with your first try.

                <p>
                  You just need to prove to yourself that you have what it takes
                  to produce something.

                  There are no artists, athletes, entrepreneurs, or scientists
                  who became great by half-finishing their work. Stop debating
                  what you should make and just make something.

                <p>
                  Everyone struggles to create great art. Even great artists.
                  Anyone who creates something on a consistent basis will begin
                  to judge their own work. I write new articles every Monday and
                  Thursday. After sticking to that publishing schedule for three
                  months, I began to judge everything I created. I was convinced
                  that I had gone through every decent idea I had available. My
                  most popular article came 8 months later.
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is natural to judge your work. It is natural to feel
                  disappointed that your creation isn't as wonderful as you
                  hoped it would be, or that you're not getting any better at
                  your craft. But the key is to not let your discontent prevent
                  you from continuing to do the work.
                </p>

                <p>
                  You have to practice enough self-compassion to not let
                  self-judgement take over. Sure, you care about your work, but
                  don't get so serious about it that you can't laugh off your
                  mistakes and continue to produce the thing you love. Don't let
                  judgment prevent delivery.

                  Share your work publicly. It will hold you accountable to
                  creating your best work. It will provide feedback for doing
                  better work. And when you see others connect with what you
                  create, it will inspire you and make you care more.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Sometimes sharing your work means you have to deal with haters
                  and critics. But more often than not, the only thing that
                  happens is that you rally the people who believe the same
                  things you believe, are excited about the same things you are
                  excited about, or who support the work that you believe in —
                  who wouldn't want that?
                </p>

                <p>
                  The world needs people who put creative work out into the
                  world. What seems simple to you is often brilliant to someone
                  else. But you'll never know that unless you choose to share.

                Is There Such a Thing as ‘Naturally Creative'?
              </h3>
              <p class="post-author"></p>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                  While we often think of creativity as an event or as a natural
                  skill that some people have and some don't, research actually
                  suggests that both creativity and non-creativity are learned.
                </p>

                <p>
                  According to psychology professor Barbara Kerr, “approximately
                  22 percent of the variance [in creativity] is due to the
                  influence of genes.” This discovery was made by studying the
                  differences in creative thinking between sets of twins.
                </p>

                <p>
                  All of this to say, claiming that “I'm just not the creative
                  type” is a pretty weak excuse for avoiding creative thinking.
                  Certainly, some people are primed to be more creative than
                  others. However, nearly every person is born with some level
                  of creative skill and the majority of our creative thinking
                  abilities are trainable.

                Creative Thinking: Destiny or Development?
              </h3>
              <p class="post-author"></p>
              <div class="post-content">
                <p>
                  Creative thinking requires our brains to make connections
                  between seemingly unrelated ideas. Is this a skill that we are
                  born with or one that we develop through practice? Let's look
                  at the research to uncover an answer.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In the 1960s, a creative performance researcher named George
                  Land conducted a study of 1,600 five-year-olds and 98 percent
                  of the children scored in the “highly creative” range. Dr.
                  Land re-tested each subject during five year increments. When
                  the same children were 10-years-old, only 30 percent scored in
                  the highly creative range. This number dropped to 12 percent
                  by age 15 and just 2 percent by age 25. As the children grew
                  into adults they effectively had the creativity trained out of
                  them. In the words of Dr. Land, “non-creative behavior is
                  learned.” Similar trends have been discovered by other
                  researchers. For example, one study of 272,599 students found
                  that although IQ scores have risen since 1990, creative
                  thinking scores have decreased.
                </p>

                <p>
                  This is not to say that creativity is 100 percent learned.
                  Genetics do play a role. According to psychology professor
                  Barbara Kerr, “approximately 22 percent of the variance [in
                  creativity] is due to the influence of genes.” This discovery
                  was made by studying the differences in creative thinking
                  between sets of twins. All of this to say, claiming that “I'm
                  just not the creative type” is a pretty weak excuse for
                  avoiding creative thinking. Certainly, some people are primed
                  to be more creative than others. However, nearly every person
                  is born with some level of creative skill and the majority of
                  our creative thinking abilities are trainable. Now that we
                  know creativity is a skill that can be improved, let's talk
                  about why—and how—practice and learning impacts your creative
                  output.

                <p>What does it take to unleash your creative potential?</p>

                <p>
                  As I mentioned in my article on Threshold Theory, being in the
                  top 1 percent of intelligence has no correlation with being
                  fantastically creative. Instead, you simply have to be smart
                  (not a genius) and then work hard, practice deliberately and
                  put in your reps.
                </p>

                <p>
                  DAs long as you meet a threshold of intelligence, then
                  brilliant creative work is well within your reach. In the
                  words of researchers from a 2013 study, “we obtained evidence
                  that once the intelligence threshold is met, personality
                  factors become more predictive for creativity.”

                  What exactly are these “personality factors” that researchers
                  are referring to when it comes to boosting your creative
                  thinking?
                </p>

                <p>
                  One of the most critical components is how you view your
                  talents internally. More specifically, your creative skills
                  are largely determined by whether you approach the creative
                  process with a fixed mindset or a growth mindset. The
                  differences between these two mindsets are described in detail
                  in Carol Dweck's fantastic book, Mindset: The New Psychology
                  of Success (audiobook).

                <p>
                  The basic idea is that when we use a fixed mindset we approach
                  tasks as if our talents and abilities are fixed and
                  unchanging. In a growth mindset, however, we believe that our
                  abilities can be improved with effort and practice.
                  Interestingly, we can easily nudge ourselves in one direction
                  or another based on how we talk about and praise our efforts.
